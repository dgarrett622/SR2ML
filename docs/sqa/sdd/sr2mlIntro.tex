\section{Introduction}
\subsection{System Purpose}

The \textbf{\textit{SR2ML}} plug-in is a generalized module for safety risk and reliability analysis within RAVEN.
\\RAVEN is a flexible and multi-purpose uncertainty quantification (UQ), regression analysis, probabilistic risk assessment
(PRA), data analysis and model optimization software.  Depending on the tasks to be accomplished and on the
probabilistic
 characterization of the problem, RAVEN perturbs (Monte-Carlo, Latin hyper-cube, reliability surface search, etc.) the
 response of the system under consideration by altering its own parameters.
 The data generated by the sampling process is analyzed using classical statistical
 and more advanced data mining approaches. RAVEN also manages the parallel dispatching (i.e. both on
 desktop/workstation and large High-Performance Computing machines) of the software representing the physical
 model.
 For more information about the RAVEN software, see ~\cite{RAVENuserManual} and the RAVEN website (\url{raven.inl.gov}
\\The  \textbf{\textit{SR2ML}} module is a dedicated module of RAVEN and one of the first developed RAVEN plug-ins.
A RAVEN plug-in is a software/module/library that has been developed to be linked to RAVEN at run-time, using the RAVEN APIs.


\subsection{System Scope}

The \textbf{\textit{SR2ML}} plug-inâ€™s scope is to provide a set of capabilities to model Event Tree/Fault Tree. The main functionalities
include:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Event Tree (ET) Model
  \item Fault Tree (FT) Model
  \item Markov Model
  \item Reliability Block Diagram (RBD) Model
  \item Event Tree Data Importer
  \item Fault Tree Data Importer
  \item Reliability Models with Time Dependent Failure Rates
\end{itemize}


 The main objective of the module (in conjunction with the RAVEN software) is to assist the engineer/user to:
\begin{itemize}
  \item identify/compute the main risk characterizing the system, structure and component (SSC);
  \item general functionalities for safety and reliability analysis;
\end{itemize}

In other words, the  \textbf{\textit{SR2ML}} plug-in (driven by RAVEN) is aimed to be employed for:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Probabilistic Safety and Risk Analysis;
  \item Reliability Analysis;
\end{itemize}


\subsection{User Characteristics}

The users of the \textbf{\textit{SR2ML}} plug-in are expected to be part of any of the
following categories:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Core developers (SR2ML core team)}: These are the developers of the \textbf{\textit{SR2ML}}  plug-in. They will be responsible for following
    and enforcing the appropriate software development standards. They will be responsible for designing, implementing and
    maintaining the plug-in.
  \item \textbf{External developers}: A Scientist or Engineer that utilizes the \textbf{\textit{SR2ML}}  plug-in and wants to extend its
  capabilities.This user will typically have a background in modeling and
simulation techniques and/or numerical and economic analysis but may only have a limited skill-set when it comes to object-oriented
coding, C++/Python languages.
  \item \textbf{Analysts}:  These are users that will run the plug-in (in conjunction with RAVEN) and perform various analysis on the
  simulations they perform. These users may interact with developers of the system requesting new features and reporting bugs found
  and will typically make heavy use of the input file format.
\end{itemize}
