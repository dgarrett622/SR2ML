\section{Introduction}
The \textbf{\textit{SR2ML}} plug-in is a generalized module for probabilistic safety, risk and reliability analysis within RAVEN.
\\The plug-in is aimed to perform probabilistic safety, risk and reliability analysis for complex system.
\\This document is aimed to report and explain the  \textbf{\textit{SR2ML}} plug-in software requirements. In addition, it reports
the traceability matrix between software requirements and requirement tests (tests that testify the software is compliant
with respect its own requirements).
