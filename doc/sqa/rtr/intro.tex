\section{Introduction}
The \textbf{\textit{SR2ML}} plug-in is a generalized module for safety risk and reliability analysis within RAVEN.
\\The plug-in is aimed to perform structure, system and component safety risk and reliability analysis.
\\This document is aimed to report the traceability matrix between software requirements
(see SR2ML SRS) and requirement tests (tests that testify the module/plug-in is compliant
with respect its own requirements).
